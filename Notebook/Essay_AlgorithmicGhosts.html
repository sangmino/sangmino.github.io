<h2> Algorithmic Ghosts </h2>

<div style="max-width:700px; margin:auto; line-height:1.6; padding:0 10px;">
I have a habit of naming my music playlists as simple chronological markers: "2022-03" for March 2022, "2023-11" for November 2023, and so on. This austere cataloging system transforms my listening history into a precisely dated archive. A few days ago, I stumbled upon the 2022-03 playlist while scrolling through my account, searching for something else entirelyâ€”that peculiar serendipity that occasionally produces more insight than any deliberate excavation. What began as background noise for a mundane afternoon quickly transformed into an auditory time machine, each track reconstructing a consciousness I had once inhabited but could no longer access through memory alone.
