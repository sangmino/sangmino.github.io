Songs that are secretly about the job market:
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7lzp5Do1YNausAcI5k7t8j?si=0aacf273897c4da6">Spotify Playlist</a>: Listen and find comfort in knowing even pop stars unwittingly understand the academic grind.</li>
</ol>

<br>
Useful reminders:
<ol>
  <li>Hemingway rewrote the last page of A Farewell to Arms 47 times. Behind Edward Hopper's masterpieces is a series of <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/how-edward-hopper-storyboarded-nighthawks-2276/">sketches</a>. Creative process is inherently messy and chaotic. </li>
  <li>If Barack Obama <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a43530028/barack-obama-reading-list/">found time to read</a> amid the Arab Spring and the killing of Osama bin Laden, so can you during the job market preparation.</li>
  <li>Parable of the arrow: When struck by a poisoned arrow, it is crucial to remove the arrow and treat the wound, rather than waste time questioning the arrow's origins or the archer's motives.</li>
  <li>Parable of the airbag: When you know with certainty that you will be in a car accident someday, invest in advanced airbag systems rather than dwell on the inevitability of the crash.</li>
  <li>Under pressure, you always go back to your habits. Building habits is preparing for the worst-case scenario.</li>
  <li>“The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.” - Sun Tzu </li>
  <li>Sprezzatura: You have to put in more effort to make something appear effortless.</li>
  <li>Clear writing gives poor thinking nowhere to hide. This is also why writing is difficult.</li>
  <li>"When you plan something well, there's no need to rush." - Thomas Shelby</li>
</ol>

<br>
To slow down time:
<ol>
    <li>Interval trainings using a fan bike.</li>
  <li>Plan out your day. See Ben Franklin's <a href = "/images/ben_franklin.jpg">example</a> or <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/daily-routines-famous-creatives/">other routines of famous creatives</a>.
  <li>Use a time tracker to record your daily activities.</li>
  <li>Start a new habit and witness how long it takes to reach 100 days</li>
</ol>

When in need of a tangible productivity boost:
<ol>
  <li>Start by creating the <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2023/01/the-right-now-list/">Right Now List</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwY7w0k3j2Y">Classical music</a> for when you’re on a deadline</li>
  <li>"5-4-3-2-1...act." -- the 5 Second Rule is a technique that helps you overcome procrastination and take action by counting down from 5 to 1 and physically moving towards your goal.</li>
  <li>AI tools to help you read papers: <a href="https://typeset.io/">Typeset</a>, <a href="https://www.unriddle.ai/">Unriddle</a></li>
  <li>"Academic writers cannot get writer’s block.  Don’t confuse yourself with your friends teaching creative writing in the fine arts department.  You’re not crafting a deep narrative or composing metaphors that expose mysteries of the human heart.  The subtlety of your analysis of variance will not move readers to tears, although the tediousness of it might.  People will not photocopy your reference list and pass it out to friends whom they wish to inspire.  Novelists and poets are the landscape artists and portrait painters; academic writers are the people with big paint sprayers who repaint your basement."
