<p>Generating Referee Report (courtesy of Alejandro Lopez-Lira)</p>
<p>"Pretend you are an extremely harsh referee for a finance top-3 journal. Write a comprehensive and critical referee report on this paper. First, write the summary of the paper. Then, focus on the major weaknesses of the paper. You must elaborate extensively on each potential weakness and back it up by referring to the specific text in the paper. You are doing this to help me anticipate any extremely critical referee report before submitting my paper, so I need you to be very strict. Pick on anything."
