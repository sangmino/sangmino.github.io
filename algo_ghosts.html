  <h2> Algorithmic Ghosts </h2>
  
  I have a habit of naming my Spotify playlists as simple chronological markers: "2022-03" for March 2022, "2023-11" for November 2023, and so on. This austere cataloging system transforms my listening history into a precisely dated archive. A few days ago, I stumbled upon the 2022-03 playlist while scrolling through my account, and what began as background noise for a mundane afternoon quickly transformed into an auditory time machine - each track reconstructing a consciousness I had once inhabited but could no longer access through memory alone.
  
  It did not take me more than a few songs in my old playlist to realize a curious doubling of perspective. Here was the empirical evidence of my past preferences, rendered in precise digital documentation, yet the emotional architecture that had made this particular arrangement of sounds so compelling remained tantalizingly beyond reach. The person who had carefully curated this sequence of songs existed now only as data, a spectral presence conjured through algorithmic recall.
