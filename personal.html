<h4> Newsletters </h4>
I currently manage two daily newsletters.

<p><a href = "https://sangmino.substack.com/">> Quote of the Day</a></p>
<p>: During my internship in Mumbai in 2015, I sent out a daily e-mail containing a sentence or two from an interesting article that I’ve read for that day. What started as a cheeky e-mail sent to fellow employees has grown into one of my daily joys, covering topics from the origin of emojis and hacked slot machines to the art of lying down and the use of typography in political campaigns.</p>

<br>
<p><a href = "https://plausiblyexog.substack.com/">> Plausibly Exogenous</a></p>
<p>: I run a newsletter called plausibly exogenous where I send out a daily email containing a source of plausibly exogenous variation used in the economics literature. You can view the cumulative list <a href="https://sangmino.notion.site/1a897b8106ca44eeaf31dcd5ae5a61b1">here</a>.</p>



<br>
<h4> Sports </h4>

<p><a href="/Documents/wenger.pdf"">> Effect of Arsene Wenger’s Tenure on Arsenal Football Club’s Brand Image</a></p>
<p>: As an avid Arsenal FC fan since 2006, I wrote about the role of Arsene Wenger and his legacy for Wharton's Marketing 101 final project.</p>



<br>
<h4> Community Service </h4>

<p><a href="https://k-pensa.org/">> K-PEnSA</a></p>
<p>: At Penn, I co-created the Korea-Penn Engineers & Scientists Association to expand the Korean engineering/sciences community to encompass undergraduate / graduate students, researchers, faculty, and alumni</p>



<br>
<h4> Fine Arts </h4>
<p>> <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/upennsquirrels/?hl=en">@upennsquirrels</a></p>
<p>: In 2014, I created an Instagram account for squirrels at University of Pennsylvania: @upennsquirrels. I still manage it to this day.</p>
