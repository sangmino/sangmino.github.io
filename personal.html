<p>: During my internship in Mumbai in 2015, I sent out a daily e-mail containing a sentence or two from an interesting article that Iâ€™ve read for that day. What started as a cheeky e-mail sent to fellow employees has grown into one of my daily joys, covering topics from the origin of emojis and hacked slot machines to the art of lying down and the use of typography in political campaigns.</p>

<p>: I run a newsletter called plausibly exogenous where I send out a daily email containing a source of plausibly exogenous variation used in the economics literature. You can view the cumulative list <a href="https://sangmino.notion.site/1a897b8106ca44eeaf31dcd5ae5a61b1">here</a>.</p>
