<h4> Newsletters </h4>
I currently manage two daily newsletters: "Quote of the Day" and "Plausibly Exogenous."

<br>
<br>
<p><a href = "https://sangmino.substack.com/">> Quote of the Day</a></p>
<font size="-1"><p>: During my internship in Mumbai in 2015, I sent out a daily e-mail containing a sentence or two from an interesting article that I’ve read for that day. What started as a cheeky e-mail sent to fellow employees has grown into one of my daily joys, covering topics from the origin of emojis and hacked slot machines to the art of lying down and the use of typography in political campaigns.</p></font>

<br>
<p><a href = "https://plausiblyexog.substack.com/">> Plausibly Exogenous</a></p>
<font size="-1"><p>: I run a newsletter called plausibly exogenous where I send out a daily email containing a source of plausibly exogenous variation used in the economics literature. You can view the cumulative list <a href="https://sangmino.notion.site/1a897b8106ca44eeaf31dcd5ae5a61b1">here</a>.</p></font>


<br>
<h4> Community Service </h4>
I strongly believe in the importance of giving back, especially to those that have played a crucial role in shaping my personal growth.

<br>
<br>
<p><a href="https://sangmino.github.io/personal/">> Standing Committee on PhD Climate</a></p>
<font size="-1"><p>In winter 2019, Chicago Booth created a Standing Committee on PhD Climate in the hopes of taking proactive steps to improve the environment within the community. I served as one of the four student members of the inaugural committee and worked with NORC to create a survey designed to assess and evaluate the general climate in the PhD program.</p></font>

<br>
<p><a href="https://k-pensa.org/">> K-PEnSA</a></p>
<font size="-1"><p>: During my undergrad years at Penn, I co-founded the Korea-Penn Engineers & Scientists Association to expand the Korean engineering/sciences community to encompass undergraduate / graduate students, researchers, faculty, and alumni</p></font>


<br>
<h4> Sports </h4>
I have been an avid <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/">Arsenal FC</a> fan since 2006, and I play soccer regularly as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/mar/25/the-question-full-backs-football">fullback</a> and as a <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/518985-defensive-midfielder-the-most-important-player-on-a-football-pitch">defensive midfielder</a>. I am also a certified Level 5 Soccer Referee (Korea Footall Association), authorized to officiate in various amateur and youth professional soccer games.

<p><a href="/Documents/wenger.pdf"">> Effect of Arsene Wenger’s Tenure on Arsenal Football Club’s Brand Image</a></p>
<font size="-1"><p>: As an avid Arsenal FC fan since 2006, I wrote about the role of Arsene Wenger and his legacy for Wharton's Marketing 101 final project.</p></font>



<br>
<h4> Fine Arts </h4>
I have dabbled in classical piano since I was 7. Besides music, I also enjoy (re)visiting Edward Hopper at The Art Institute of Chicago, documenting the daily lives of squirrels, and reading articles from <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>, Paul Graham's <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a>, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/personal-essays">The New Yorker</a>.
