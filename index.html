<p>Assistant Professor of Finance, <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/">Columbia Business School</a></p>

<p>My research is broadly within economics and finance, focusing on <b>asset pricing</b>, <b>investments</b>, and <b>insurance</b>. My work focuses on how market structures and societal shifts shape the pricing and allocation of risk across financial markets, with a focus on investor behavior and often leveraging ML/AI tools.</p>
