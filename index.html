<p>My research is broadly within economics and finance, focusing on <b>asset pricing</b>, <b>investments</b>, and <b>insurance</b>. My work focuses on how institutional frictions impact the pricing of risk, with a focus on market dynamics and investor behavior and often leveraging machine learning tools.</p>
