<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania in finance (B.S.) and electrical engineering (M.S., B.S.). Before starting graduate school, I interned in the Global Stock Selection team at AQR Capital Management and Special Situations team at Forefront Capital Management (Mumbai, India).

<p> June 2021: I was recently awarded the Yiran Fan Memorial Prize, generously established by Lars Hansen and Grace Tsiang in memory of Yiran Fan and his contributions to the Chicago Booth community. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/why-booth/stories/in-memoriam-phd-student-yiran-fan">Please take a moment</a> to commemorate Yiran's kind and generous spirit and his devotion to bringing fellow students, young researchers, and faculty as companions in learning.
