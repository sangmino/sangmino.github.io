<p> June 2021: I was recently awarded the Yiran Fan Memorial Prize, generously established by Lars Hansen and Grace Tsiang in memory of Yiran Fan and his contributions to the Chicago Booth community. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/why-booth/stories/in-memoriam-phd-student-yiran-fan">Please take a moment</a> to commemorate Yiran's kind and generous spirit and his devotion to bringing fellow students, young researchers, and faculty as companions in learning.
