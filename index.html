<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania in finance (B.S.) and electrical engineering (M.S., B.S.). Before starting graduate school, I interned in the Global Stock Selection team at AQR Capital Management and Special Situations team at Forefront Capital Management (Mumbai, India). While still in college, I served in the 5th Armor Brigade, Republic of Korea Army as an operations analyst.</p>
